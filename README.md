# Hotel Booking Cancellations Data Analysis

### Objective

Analyze hotel booking data to investigate cancellations and their underlying patterns by addressing key questions with MS Excel. Suggest measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure revenue by preparing a visually appealing dashboard.

### Methodology

#### 1. Data Collection

Collected the hotel booking dataset and imported it into MS Excel using Power Query for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The Excel file can be found in my project repository as "Hotel_Booking".

#### 2. Data Cleaning

Check the different columns and rows of the dataset for inconsistencies, anomalies (outliers, missing values), and redundant (duplicate) values. If any issues are found, replace and remove them for more accurate and efficient results after analysis.

#### 3. Data Processing

After data cleaning, process or transform the data according to the data analysis requirements. This step prepares the data for in-depth analysis.

#### 4. Data Analysis

Analyze the dataset by addressing all key sample questions. The key questions used for analysis are provided in the project repository as "Key Questions".

#### 5. Present the Data

This is the final step where a report will be presented to the hotel management team by creating a visually appealing dashboard. The Hotel Booking Cancellations report is created after analyzing the dataset using pivot tables and charts. The report includes crucial insights that will help the hotel owner to establish a robust cancellation policy to mitigate last-minute cancellations and ensure stable and healthy revenue.
